# Project Summary

My project attempted to build a website that could function as a social media-like website for film production, specifically crew and actors looking to find work. This website is built in TypeScript with React, Vite, and Docker for overall management, and Prisma & MySQL for its backend.  

As I was not able to finish a full working project by the time of the deadline, I do not have any diagrams, photos, or videos of my website in motion.  

# Experience / Lessons Learned

As much as I wasn't able to finish this project by the deadline, this in itself taught me an extremely valuable lesson about the importance of proper time management. If I had sacrificed time in more areas over the semester, notably when we were encouraged to first begin the project or skipped vacation during Thanksgiving break, I could've had more time to work on and finish the project.  

I've also learned that complete instructions on how to build out a fully functional site like this aren't immediately accessible or obvious if a project of this scale is tackled. Due to the wide variety of tools and services, the hardest part of building a site like this can merely be figuring everything out at the beginning. I was able to do what I did thanks to my experience as a web developer as a part-time job, but for anyone without that knowledge, this task is dauntingly difficult.

I'm also motivated to complete this website as a personal project to help my chances in the increasingly difficult job market. With a heavy amount of the work done, I believe it wouldn't be a huge effort to finish and bring the website to fruition in the future. (Minus the costs of hosting the server as a real site, of course).

# Did your project integrate with AI?

No. I do not believe that apps or websites that act as a fancy frontend for AI chatbots are a viable product long-term, although I realize this is very much not the same feeling that the industry at large feels. This may be the artist within me that has disdain for its massive impact on our modern life.

# How did you use AI to assist in building your project?

I used AI to start the groundwork for the project, namely building out the basic frontend structure as I wasn't sure how all the pieces would connect together at the beginning.

# Discuss why this project is interesting to you!

As filmmaking is my dream job, I'm chiefly aware of the lack of structure within the industry. It can be really difficult to find work as a crew member or even an actor, and every region has its own preferred platform (for ex: Utah uses Facebook groups). A centralized website with an easy-to-navigate feed and search functionality would be a massive upgrade for entry-level filmmakers like myself.

# Key learnings from the project (please try to come up with at least 3)

1. START EARLIER THAN YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED TO START!!!
2. There's no shame in copying a well-worn structure you're familiar with for established technology like this.
3. Personal coding projects can be so much more gratifying to work on if it's for a cause you are passionate about.
